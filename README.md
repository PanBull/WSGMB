# WSGMB
WSGMB is a computational framework that can classify diseased or healthy microbial co-occurrence networks. It treats microbial co-occurrence networks as weight signed graphs and uses a weight signed graph convolutional layer to aggregate the sign and weight information of edges in the graph. It identifies biomarkers in a microbial community that may be associated with a specific disease, providing targets for biological and clinical research. WSGMB consists of a combination of three main components, an inference module for constructing the microbial co-occurrence network, a classification module for classifying the co-occurrence networks, and an evaluation module for measuring node importance.
# Input data
WSGMB only supports binary outcome classification with healthy or diseased microbial co-occurrence networks as input. Before this, the user needs to obtain microbial abundance tables from various microbial databases at a specific level of biology classification, either the original OTU tables or the species abundance tables after going through the species databases.
# Building microbial co-occurrence networks
The [SparCC](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002687) method was used to infer correlations between microbes, where we filtered the correlations using a truncation threshold, retaining only pairs of species with strong correlations. An example of the construction of a co-occurrence network using simulated and real data can be found in getNetwork.R.
